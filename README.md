and another item.

   You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading space ( at least one, but we'll use  three here to also align the raw Markdown).
   To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.  
   Note that this line is seperate, but within the same paragraph.  
   (This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)
* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses
[I'm an inline-style link] (https://www.google.com)
[I'm an inline-style line with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")
[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]
[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LiCENSE)
[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]
or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].
URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.
http://www.example.com or <http://example.com> and sometimes example.com (but not on Github, for example).
Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.
